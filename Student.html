	<h1>welcome to students page</h1>
<p>A student is primarily a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution who attends classes in a course to attain the appropriate 
level of mastery of a subject under the guidance of an instructor and who devotes time outside class to do whatever activities the instructor assigns 
that are necessary either for class preparation or to submit evidence of progress towards that mastery.</br>In the broader sense, a student is anyone 
who applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement with some matter necessary to master it as part of some practical affair in which such 
mastery is basic or decisive.</p>
